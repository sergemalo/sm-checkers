This project will help me to learn and pratice the following this

1. Rust language programming [Always WIP]
2. Design Patterns:
   Observer [DONE]
   Strategy [Partial, each Player implements a different strategy]
   Command [TODO, each players sends commands to the Game Ctrl - TBD: add "undo" feature]
4. Rust unit testing [DONE, easy with cargo test]
5. Github CI/CD pipeline for Rust [DONE, all in place!]
6. Machine Learning: I would like to create a Checkers learner [TODO]

Inspiration came from reading the chapter 1 of the book "Machine Learning" by Tom M. Mitchel
