This project will help me to learn and pratice the following this

1. Rust language programming
2. Design Patterns: Observer, Stratgegy, Command
3. Rust unit testing
4. Github CI/CD pipeline for Rust
5. Machine Learning: I would like to create a Checkers learner

Inspiration came from reading the chapter 1 of the book "Machine Learning" by Tom M. Mitchel
